# Drum-Kit Project
Hello! As a drummer, I wanted to combine my passion for music with my web development skills, so I created a simple drum kit project. This web-based drum kit responds to user interactions through both mouse clicks and keyboard presses. I built this responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it an interactive and fun way to experiment with drumming online.
